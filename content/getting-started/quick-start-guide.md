This quick start guide will familiarize you with setting up the Catalyst work environment in under ten minutes. With this guide, you can quickly learn the basic steps involved in developing a Catalyst application.

You can access detailed step-by-step tutorials on building applications and microservices involving different Catalyst components from the Tutorials section.

### Prerequisites:

1. Node.js and NPM for your platform to install Catalyst CLI and to develop Node.js functions 
2. Java SE Development Kit to develop Java functions 
3. Any IDE tool for coding the client or the functions.

### Step 1: Create a Catalyst project

The first step in developing a Catalyst application is to create a Catalyst project for it.

1. Log in to the Catalyst console and click Create a new Project. 
2. Enter the project’s name in the pop-up window. 
3. Read and accept Zoho Catalyst’s terms of service and click Create. 
4. Click Access Project to open it.

You can now set up and work with the Catalyst components from the console. Refer to the Component Help resources to learn about the Catalyst components in detail.

### Step 2: Install Catalyst CLI

Install Catalyst CLI to develop, test, and deploy Catalyst applications from your local system. Refer to this help page for a detailed guide.

### Step 3: Log in from your CLI

1. Execute this command to log in to your Zoho account from the CLI:
2. Press Y to allow Catalyst to collect CLI error reports and press Enter. 
3. Sign in using your credentials in the Zoho accounts login page. 
4. Click Accept to provide data access permissions to the CLI. 
5. Close the browser window and continue using the CLI in your terminal.

### Step 4: Initialize the project from the CLI

1. Create a folder for the project on your local machine and navigate to it from the terminal. 
2. Execute this command from that directory to initialize a Catalyst project in it:
3. Select the components that you need to set up for your Catalyst application and press Enter. You can initialize functions and the client.
4. Associate the directory with a Catalyst project by selecting a project from the list and press Enter. 
5. If you initialize a function, select a function type and the stack, and press Enter.

### Step 5: Develop the application

You can now work with the components you initialized in your Catalyst project and use any IDE tool of your choice to code the functions or the client. Refer to the following help documentations for detailed help on working with the Catalyst SDK and API resources:

 Java SDK help documentation 
 Node.js SDK help documentation 
 Web SDK help documentation 
 API help documentation

### Step 6: Test the application locally

After you develop the Catalyst application or microservice, you can test it locally from the CLI before deploying it to the Catalyst web console.

After you develop the Catalyst application or microservice, you can test it locally from the CLI before deploying it to the Catalyst web console.

### Step 7: Deploy the project

After you test the application, you can deploy it to the remote console by executing this command from your project directory:

Your application can now be accessed from its production URL. You can also host the application directly from the console through web client hosting.
