Catalyst Functions are custom-built coding structures which contain the intense business logic of your application. Functions allow you to store the functionality of the application in a centralized and secure place, rather than storing it within the application's main code. The application uses APIs to invoke functions from the Catalyst servers when needed.

Catalyst offers support to develop server-side functions in two programming environments:

1. **Java**

2. **Node.js**

3. **Test Entry**

Catalyst Test Functions is one of the [two basic project components of a Catalyst application](https://www.zoho.com/catalyst/help/project-directory-structure.html), along with the client. You can seamlessly integrate other Catalyst components with the user-defined functions to provide the powerful backend that the application requires. You can use them to automate tasks, perform memory-intensive computations, or integrate with third-party services.

You can create four types of functions in Catalyst for different purposes:

1. **Basic I/O Functions:** Simple functions used for basic input and output operations, passing a String as the I/O parameter\.

2. **Advanced I/O Functions:** Advanced HTTP functions that support Headers, and Native Request and Response objects\.

3. **Event Functions:** Event-driven functions that are invoked by specific events configured using [Event Listeners](https://www.zoho.com/catalyst/help/event-listeners.html)\.

4. **Cron Functions:** [Cron](https://www.zoho.com/catalyst/help/cron.html) based functions that are invoked one time or periodically based on the cron job's configured schedule\.

You can either work with functions using the Catalyst CLI and an external IDE, or work with them directly from the Catalyst web console. This document explains the concepts related to functions and working with them from the Catalyst web console. To learn about working with them in a local environment, refer to this section for links to relevant CLI help pages.

**Note:**
 Catalyst Java functions can only be created and coded using the Catalyst CLI and an external editor, and deployed or uploaded to the web console. You cannot code them directly in the web console as of now.


You can refer to the [Catalyst SDK documentation](https://www.zoho.com/catalyst/help/) to learn about the Java and Node.js SDK packages. To practice working with Catalyst Functions, refer to the [Tutorials](https://www.zoho.com/catalyst/help/tutorials/).
