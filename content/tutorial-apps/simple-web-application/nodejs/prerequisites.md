# Prerequisites

Before you begin building the application, you must have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

{{%list class="bold"%}}1. **Catalyst CLI**

You must perform the following actions:

   1.  **Install Catalyst CLI:** Catalyst CLI is installed through NPM. You must therefore have NPM and Node.js installed on your system before you install the CLI.
